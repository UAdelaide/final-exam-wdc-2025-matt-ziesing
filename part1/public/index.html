    <h1>Welcome to the Dog Walking Service!</h1>

    <button type="button" class="top-right">Book a Walk</button>
    <p>I'm muffins! i'm a dog that is in LOVE with cats! That's right! I know it sounds
    crazy because floofy doogos aren't supposed to breed with sassy kitties but I grew up
    with them and have just never really wanted anything to o with other puppers. It just feels
    so good to be a big strong dog loving a slender and fragile kitty! I can't help myself! Their long
    tail seductively swishing effortlessly through the air... I'm getting too excited now! I need to go
    to the park! I'm going to go play now!</p>
